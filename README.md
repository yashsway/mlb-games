# MLB Games App
###### An micro-app that let's you see game information on any particular day and details about that day, specifically the innings and the statistics of the batters.

## Technologies used
Vue.js - learnt it today to build the app, I've always wanted to build something with it, perfect opp to do so  
Webpack - bundling tool (will use poi in the future) 
NPM - do we even have to list this anymore? haha  
PostCSS - it's better than SASS, seriously  
CSSNext - a plugin for PostCSS, makes media queries and reusable classes  
Lodash - array and collection fxs  
Moment.js - time and date formatting  
Express.js - node based server for prod deployment  
CSSGrid - upcoming, amazing css layout spec, flexbox was great, this is incredible
